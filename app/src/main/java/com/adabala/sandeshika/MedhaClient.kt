/**
 * A complete Medha client in one file, lifted from Medha's own
 * `samples/hello-medha` and unchanged apart from the package.
 *
 * Kept as a copy rather than a shared dependency on purpose: Sandeshika must
 * build and run with no knowledge of Medha's source tree, exactly like any
 * third-party consumer. If this file needs Medha's internals to work, the
 * integration contract is wrong and that should be visible here rather than
 * hidden behind a project reference.
 *
 * Original notes follow.
 *
 * A complete Medha client in one file, using nothing but `HttpURLConnection`
 * and `org.json` — both in the Android platform, no Retrofit, no OkHttp, no
 * dependencies to add. Copy it into your project and change the package.
 *
 * Deliberately not clever. The point is that talking to Medha is ordinary
 * HTTP, and seeing the raw request/response shapes is more useful to someone
 * integrating than a tidy abstraction that hides them.
